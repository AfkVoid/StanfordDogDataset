# StanfordDogDataset
This project was done using the stanford dog dataset which includes roughly 16000 pictures of 120 different dog breeds. Python, Pytorch were used to clean and build the neural network models. Tenserflow was used for data analytics/model optimization. In the code above the chosen model was resnet-18 however I also tested resnet-34, resnet-50, resnet-101, resnet-152 , VGG11, and VGG16 while changing various factors such as the image color, number of epochs, epoch size, etc. This was all done to find the best model to predict what dog breed a dog in a picture is and to learn more about neural networks and the models used for classification.
